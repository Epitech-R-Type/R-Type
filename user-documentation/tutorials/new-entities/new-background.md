# New background

since backgrounds are just enemies that only have velocity, position and animation components,\
you create them similar to normal enemies.

* to create a new background follow the steps in [New Graphics](../new-graphics.md)
* then you can specify the background by its AnimationID in the [level file](../new-levels.md#content-of-a-level-file)
