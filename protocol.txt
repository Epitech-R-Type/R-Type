   server communication protocol implemented during the Epitech R-Type
   project. The protocol as described in this document contains all
   necessary commands a client must implement in order to participate
   in games run by the R-Type server.

1. Introduction

    The R-Type project is an epitech project that aims to produce a
    multiplayer game based on the R-Type game.

    This project aims to introduce students to the intricate details of
    building a networked multiplayer game while also focusing on the
    package the game is delivered in. This includes but is not limited
    to :
    
        - Crossplatform build system
        - Limited user setup required
        - Multithreaded server
        - Inability to cheat using modified client
