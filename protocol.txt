                      R-TYPE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

Abstract

   This document provides an in depth specification of the client <->
   server communication protocol implemented during the Epitech R-Type
   project. The protocol as described in this document contains all
   necessary commands a client must implement in order to participate
   in games run by the R-Type server.

Status of this Memo

   This memo is the specification of the Communication Protocol
   implemented by its authors for the R-Type Epitech project. This
   specification is an exercise in the writing of an rfc document as
   defined by RFC 7322 "RFC Style Guide". This specification does not
   aim to be submitted at any point in time.

1. Introduction

    The R-Type project is an epitech project that aims to produce a
    multiplayer game based on the R-Type game.

    This project aims to introduce students to the intricate details of
    building a networked multiplayer game while also focusing on the
    package the game is delivered in. This includes but is not limited
    to :
    
        - Crossplatform build system
        - Limited user setup required
        - Multithreaded server
        - Inability to cheat using modified client

2. TCP Protocol

    The TCP protocol will serve as the main protocol used by the client
    and server before the start of a game. It will also serve the
    purpose of handling anything non relevent to the game currently
    being played. The sole exception to that last bit will be the
    handling of in game messaging and server message broadcasting.

    2.1. Command Syntax

        TCP commands follow the following syntax :

                <CMD> <SP> <HEADER>;<ARGS> <CRLF>

        Here is a definition of each part :

        <CMD>    -> This is the command name and will always be fully
                    capitalized.

        <SP>     -> Ascii space character

        <HEADER> -> For client commands, user UUID. For server commands,
                    server UUID. Both distributed by server on
                    connection.
        
        <ARGS>   -> Arguments for given command. These args are
                    separated by the ',' ascii character.

        <CRLF>   -> Carriage Return Line Feed character. Every message
                    will end in this character combination denoted
                    '\r\n' in ascii.

    2.2. Command Response

        All client sent commands will generate a response from the
        server allowing the client to know the status of their command.

        Responses will follow the following syntax :

                <CODE> <SP> <HEADER> <SP> <BODY> <CRLF>

        In this format, the HEADER is the server's UUID, that the client
        can use in order to make sure he is interacting with the correct
        server.

        The response format is similar to the command synthaxe, except
        that the cmd is replaced by a three digit response code that
        mimics that of the HTTP protocol.
    
        2.2.1. Response Codes and Meanings

            The following is a list of all possible response code. This
            list of response codes is strongly inspired by the response
            codes of the HTTP protocol.

                - 500 -> Wrong Request
                - 401 -> Forbidden
                - 200 -> OK

    2.3. Server Commands

        The only server command that currently needs any handling by the
        client is the START command.

        The START command will provide one argument, which is the port
        that the client should send his first UDP message to.
    
    2.4. Client Commands

        The following is a list of Client Commands :

            - CONNECT -> Only command with no header. This command
                         allows the client to retrieve his user assigned
                         uuid.

            - START   -> This command allows the user to signal to the
                         server that the game should start.



3. UDP Protocol

    The UDP protocol will be the main protocol used to communicated the
    behaviour of the game to clients during any given game.
    
    Since in this project the server is supposed to handle most of the
    game logic this protocol will be centered around the ECS and
    communicating it's state over the course of a given game.

    NO UDP SERVER COMMAND will await any type of response.

    3.1. Command Synthax

        Commands follow the following syntax :

                <CMD> <SP> <ARGS> <CRLF>
        
        Here is a definition of each part :

        <CMD>  -> This is the command name and will always be fully
                  capitalized.

        <SP>   -> Ascii space character

        <ARGS> -> These are the arguments for the command. The size of
                  these args may vary even within the same command. For
                  this purpose each argument will be separated by the
                  ';' character.
                  
                  Any sub-argument within each argument will be
                  separated by the ',' character.

        <CRLF> -> Carriage Return Line Feed character. Every message
                  will end in this character combination denoted '\r\n'
                  in ascii.
        
        Here is an example of a valid server command :

                             DEL_ENT 1 \r\n
        
    3.2. Server Commands

        This section details the commands sent by the server to clients
        along with their usage.

        3.2.1 Server Command Listing

            The following is a listing of all valid server commands :

                    ENTITY        ->    Provide entity description, with
                                        component args.
                    DEL_ENT       ->    Delete entity
                    DEL_COMP      ->    Delete component
                    CHANGE_MUSIC  ->    Change Song
                    GAME_END      ->    Signals end of game

        3.2.2. Server Command Arguments

            The following is an explanation of the arguments needed for
            each server command :

                      <THIS LIST NEEDS ELABORATING>

            ENTITY ->
                (entity id, (component id, component args...)...)
            DEL_ENT -> (entity id)
            DEL_COMP -> (entity id, component id)
            MUSIC -> (song id)

    3.3. Client Commands

        This section details the commands sent by the client to the
        server along with their arguments and usage.

        In contrast with Server Commands, some of these commands will
        elicit a response.

        3.3.1. Server Response

            The server response to client commands will always be in the
            form of server commands. This means and allows the client to
            not have to wait on the server response as the "server
            response" only needs to be handled like any other command.

        3.3.2. Client Command Listing

            These commands WILL illicit a response, this response will
            take the form of commands, so should not be waited for:

                HERE        ->      Signal connection to server
                GET_ENT     ->      Get specification for entity

            These commands WILL NOT illicit any response:

                ACT_SHOOT   ->      Signal the server that the client
                                    shot.
                ACT_MOVE    ->      Signal the server that the client
                                    has moved.
                PING        ->      Signal server that client is
                                    still connected. Required every
                                    three seconds.

        3.3.3. Client Command Arguments

            The following is a listing of the arguments for each client
            command.

                GET_ENT     ->      (entity id)
                ACT_SHOOT   ->      No arguments
                ACT_MOVE    ->      (direction)
                HERE        ->      (client UUID)
